# mapPropsCallbag
> Map callbag to your props (reactjs component)

Inspirated from mapProps from recompose.

This project is just a try out, but you can install the HoC with: `yarn add mapPropsCallbag` and feel free to open PR to discuss :)

You can find an example here: [list.container.js](./packages/example-ui/src/screens/list/list.container.js)
You can start the example by cloning this repository and run this:
